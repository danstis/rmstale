## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour to [project maintainers](mailto:rmstale@bsod.co.nz).

## Before You Start

rmstale is a small, lightweight, cross-platform tool intended primarily for command-line usage. While contributions that add functionality specific to one platform are welcome, they should not impair the tool's operation on other platforms. Similarly, while we welcome additions that introduce new user interfaces, these should not detract from the command-line interface.
